This library is designed to be a drop-in replacement for the
Haskell Data.Sequence library documented here:

http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/libraries/containers/Data-Sequence.html

Like Data.Sequence, Data.FastSequence makes use of finger trees in
order to provide O(lg n) concatenation and indexing.  However, it uses
much wider vector-style nodes rather than the 2-3 tree nodes used in
Data.Sequence.  It is intended to run faster in practice than
Data.Sequence; substantial performance regressions should be
considered a bug.

For now, though, the code is still under development and testing.
